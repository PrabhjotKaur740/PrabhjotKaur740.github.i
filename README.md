### Day 1 - 10-07-2024

The beginning of my college journey starts with listening and reciting kirtan at the Gurdwara Sahib of the College campus. It was a positive and great experience to receive the blessings before stating the new jouney. After that we were made to sit in the auditorium and then we listen to the speeches given by the guests of day 1. The guests of Day 1 induction program were:-

Pr. Dr. Sehijpal singh welcomed us to the GNDEC campus and intoduce us about the campus facilities and benefits. The director of Nankana Sahib Education Trust highlighted that Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College was established to honor Nanakana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev ji. It was founded with the goal of addressing economic backwardness through technology. The foundation stone of the college was laid in 1956. The vision of college is to admit 70% rural students to benefit them with the advancement of technology. Er. Jiwandeep Singh who is serving as a PCS officer advice us to never wait for the oppprotunity to come to you, grap the opportunity. We should learn to grab the opportunity whenever we get chance. Never let it go. SSP Rajeshwar Singh encouraged us to always walk onto the path of good deeds and helping others. Every good deed  and every bad deed we do always count. He encouraged us to embrace four essential phrases: 
1. I am Sorry
2. Please forgive me

Afer every mistake and lie we should be sorry to the god immediately. We can lie to everyone but we cannot lie to ourselves and God. We ourselves knows the truth behind our lie.

### Need for Value Education
All human beings aspire for a happy, fulfilling life. For a human being, there are two important questions pertaining to this:-
- What is my aspiration?
- How to fullfill your aspiration?

The purpose of education is to facilitate the development of clarity on the aspiration and adequate competence to actualize it.
For this it is essential to understand what a happy, fulfilling and successful life is- what is really valuable for human being: What is purpose of human being? It is also necessary to learn the skills to actualise our aspiration. This is the skill domain.
Value and skills go hand in hand. Both value and skills are required. There is an essentiaal complementary between the two. But more importantly, the prime need of value education is to understand human aspirations, to discover what is truly valuable in life; and work out on the program for its fulfillment.  
*Leading to harmony*: It ultimately needs to promote harmony within the individual, among human beings and with the entier nature.

### Day 7- 18-07-2024

On the Day 7 of induction program the first class of UHF inwhich learn about the following things.
## Understanding the Human Being

So what is Human being? The proposal of human being is the coexistence of the Self and the Body. Self is what we term as "I" and Body is what we see with our eyes.

### The needs of the Self and Body

The need of Self is happiness (e.g. feeeling of respect leading to happiness) while the nedd of body is physical facility (e.g. food). All the need related to the Self are continuous in time while all the needs related to the Body are required for a limited time. This is one way we can differentiate between the need of the Self and the need of the Body.
The other way to see the difference between the difference between the two is in erms of quantity and quality. The need for food is quantitavie in nature. We can identify the quality of the food needed to nurture our body.

### The Activities of the Self and Body

The Self has the activity of desire, thought and expectations which are continuous. On the other hand, any activity of the Body, like eating, walking, etc. is temporary in time.

### The response of the Self and Body

The response of the Body is based on recognising and fulfilling  whereas the response of the Self is based on knowing, assuming, recognising and fullfilling. The recognition and fulfillment of the Body is definite, while that of Self is determined by the activity of assuming. As assumption changes, the recognition and fulfillment by the Self also changes.
All the problems of a human being are due to assumptions wuithoiut  knowing, and the solution lies in ensuring the activity of kowing. And this is possible only through education-sanskar.

### Understanding harmony in Self

The activities of the self can be seen in terms of desire, thought and expectations. These powers are inexhaustible, and the activities are continuous. The activiities of imaging, analyzing-comparing and selecting-tasting are always going on, whether we aware of them or not.
If your imagination is guided by your natural acceptance, you are sure to be in harmony and happiness within. You are Self-orgarnised.

#### Ensuring harmony in the Self by way of Self-exploration
 To achieve the harmony in the Self, we need to self-exploration. In the process, we need to:
 - Know our natural acceptance
 - Be aware of our imagination
 - Find out the source of imagination
 - Work out a way to sort out outr imagination till it is fully in line with our natural acceptance
When the imagination is in harmony with the natural acceptance, there is harmony in the Self. This harmony is happiness.
